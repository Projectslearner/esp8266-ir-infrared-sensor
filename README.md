# ESP8266 IR Infrared Sensor Project

#### Project Overview
The ESP8266 IR Infrared Sensor project demonstrates how to use an IR infrared sensor with an ESP8266 microcontroller to detect the presence of an object. The sensor emits and detects infrared radiation reflected off objects, sending signals to the ESP8266, which interprets and displays the detection status on the Serial Monitor.

#### Components Needed
- **ESP8266 Microcontroller**
- **IR Infrared Sensor Module**
- **Jumper Wires**
- **Power Supply**

#### Circuit Setup
1. **Connecting the IR Infrared Sensor:**
   - **Signal Pin:** Connect to GPIO pin D2 on the ESP8266.
   - **VCC:** Connect to a 3.3V or 5V pin on the ESP8266, depending on sensor specifications.
   - **GND:** Connect to a GND pin on the ESP8266 for common ground.

#### Instructions
1. **Setup:**
   - Upload the provided Arduino code to the ESP8266 using the Arduino IDE.
   - Open the Serial Monitor to view the object detection status.

2. **Testing:**
   - Ensure the IR infrared sensor is correctly positioned and powered.
   - Observe the Serial Monitor for real-time updates on object detection ("Object detected!" or "No object detected.").

#### Applications
- **Security Systems:** Use in security systems to detect movement or presence of objects.
- **Automation:** Integrate into home automation projects for object detection triggering actions.
- **Industrial Applications:** Implement in industrial automation for object presence detection in machinery.

#### Notes
- **Sensor Placement:** Position the IR infrared sensor to cover the desired detection area effectively.
- **Sensitivity Adjustment:** Adjust sensor sensitivity as needed to optimize object detection accuracy.
- **Environmental Considerations:** Minimize interference from ambient infrared sources for reliable operation.
